## 🌟 Overview

This repository contains a rigorous, self-contained introduction to **Geometric Numerical Integration (GNI)**. It is designed to bridge the gap between elementary principles and graduate-level understanding, unifying geometric, algebraic, and analytic perspectives.

The content has been refactored from a single monolithic document into a modular, multi-chapter structure for better readability and maintainability.

## 📚 Table of Contents

The material is organized into the following modules. You can start reading from the **[Main Table of Contents](toc.html)**.
